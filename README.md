# Horizon - Bank/Budget App

Horizon is a full-fledged banking and budgeting application built using the latest NextJS. It leverages **[Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/)** for the backend services, **[Plaid](https://plaid.com/)** for bank communication, **[Dwolla](https://www.dwolla.com/)** for transaction handling, and **[Sentry](https://sentry.io/)** for monitoring issues. This README file serves as a guide to set up, configure, and understand the Horizon project.

> **A working demo can be found at: https://banking-nextjs-eight.vercel.app/**

## Features

- **Bank Account Integration:** Connects with Plaid to securely fetch and display bank account information.
- **Transaction Management:** Uses Dwolla to handle transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- **Budget Tracking:** Allows users to set budgets, categorize transactions, and monitor expenses.
- **Secure Authentication:** Utilizes Appwrite for user authentication and session management.
- **Issue Monitoring:** Sentry is integrated for real-time error tracking and monitoring.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Next.js to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience across devices.

1. Build the Application:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

2. Serve the Application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

3. Configure Production Environment Variables:

   Make sure to set environment variables in your production environment similar to [`.env.example`](./.env.example) but ensure they are securely managed.

## Issue Monitoring with Sentry

Sentry is integrated into Horizon to help monitor and track issues in real-time. To view and manage issues:

- Log in to your Sentry account.
- Navigate to your project dashboard.
- Monitor and manage errors as they occur in your Horizon application.

## Testing Guide

Below are instructions for testing the Horizon prototype website. Please follow these steps to sign up and explore the functionalities integrated with Plaid's sandbox environment.

### Sign Up Process

#### 1. Account Registration:

- Fill out the signup form with accurate information. The form is straightforward, but ensure that fields are completed as per the placeholders provided.
- Sample user credentials that work:
  ![Sign up credentials](./screenshots/Signup.png)

#### 2. Linking to Plaid Sandbox Account:

- After signing up, you'll be prompted to link a bank account. This process is in a sandbox environment, so no real banking details are required.
- Select any bank from the list and proceed to log in.
- When prompted to log in to the **`First Platypus bank`**, use the following credentials:

  ```bash
  # Username
  user_good

  # Password
  pass_good
  ```

- For identity verification and account connection, follow the simulated steps as presented.

  ![Verification Code](./screenshots/verification-code.png)

  > **Note:** Due to regional limitations (Europe or US), connection processes may vary in speed based on your location.

#### 3. Dashboard:

- Upon completing the setup with Plaid and Dwolla, you will be redirected to your dashboard.
- The dashboard will display simulated transactions and account balances for testing purposes.

### Important Notes

- **Prototype Status:** Horizon is a prototype with a primary focus on bank integration and transaction handling. Please be aware that there may be undiscovered issues, especially with form validations.

- **Support:** While I won't be actively maintaining this project, I appreciate your efforts in testing. Your feedback on issues encountered will be valuable for future development.
