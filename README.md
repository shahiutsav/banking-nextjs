# Horizon - Bank/Budget App

Horizon is a full-fledged banking and budgeting application built using the latest NextJS. It leverages **[Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/)** for the backend services, **[Plaid](https://plaid.com/)** for bank communication, **[Dwolla](https://www.dwolla.com/)** for transaction handling, and Sentry for monitoring issues. This README file serves as a guide to set up, configure, and understand the Horizon project.

## Features

- **Bank Account Integration:** Connects with Plaid to securely fetch and display bank account information.
- **Transaction Management:** Uses Dwolla to handle transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- **Budget Tracking:** Allows users to set budgets, categorize transactions, and monitor expenses.
- **Secure Authentication:** Utilizes Appwrite for user authentication and session management.
- **Issue Monitoring:** Sentry is integrated for real-time error tracking and monitoring.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Next.js to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience across devices.
